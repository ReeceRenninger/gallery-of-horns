// REBUILD AS A CLASS COMPONENT

//1st Bring in our imports
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Main from './Main';

//2nd Create the CLASS - will always have a RENDER method
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // <></> is a fragment that can be used to return MULTIPLE children as a blank parent
      <> 
        <Header />
        <Main />
      </>
    )
  }
}

//3rd We export our created class for other files to import
export default App;
